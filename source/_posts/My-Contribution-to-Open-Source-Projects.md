## To-do List
* Hexo 
    * hexo-browsersync doesn't work sometimes.
    * The formulas don't wrap properly, i.e. if you insert `\\` between two formulas, they will stay in the same line instead of two lines. The reason is `marked.js` escapes `\` incorrectly.
    * Add `category_case` and `tag_case`.
* reveal-md.js
    * Fix syntax conflicts between LaTeX and Markdown indirectly.
* Markdown Preview
    * Make the preview page scroll synchronously.
    * Make the formulas block needn't be preceded and followed by an empty line.
* Markdown Editing
    * Make the `$` can be paired automatically.
* Python-Markdown
    * Show math in TOC correctly without external attribute.

## Done List
* reveal.js
    * [Make equations can be numbered automatically.](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/2564)
